- The CSS framework was done by materialize.

Materialize employs the philosophy of modern design by Google’s Material design. Its target is bringing uniformity to Google UI on all possible platforms. The main focus of this philosophy is set on how UI elements interact and behave visually.

The framework is a library that packs HTML, CSS (written in Sass), and JS that combines the best practices for design, browser portability, and responsiveness. It’s extremely lightweight at 29K and comes with built-in easy to use features, flow texts, parallaxes, hoverable items, and other essential functionalities.

Since Materialize is an actual implementation of Material Design, the elements utilize motion and depth. All animations and transitions are smooth and neat and behave as they provide optimal use of the screen.

- JQuery was used as opposed to Javascript.

It's benefits include:

Enables developers/programmers to write JavaScript faster and easier

Works with multiple browsers, so the code is compatible regardless of whatever features the browser contains

Compresses the most common JavaScript actions into fewer lines of code

Helps you avoid common browser errors

Simplifies complex operations such as animation, event handling, and Ajax interactions

It’s a tool with proven success, thanks to almost 15 years of widespread use

- Font Awesome was used for Icons

When you design a website, images take up a lot of web space due to their file sizes. They also have to be called up to your web pages using HTML markup. Not only that, but their scaling is frequently a problem, losing definition as they are increased in size. A regular image only resolves as intended when used in its originally designed dimensions.

When you are seeking standard icon images, such as for vehicles, certain punctuation characters or graphical charting icons, icon fonts can offer you scalable images that look the same irrespective of the size of the font. This is just as letters and numbers appear the same irrespective of whether you use a size 2 or 5 or a 10 or 24 point font size.

In many cases, people simply do not use images because of this problem, and their article or online report suffers in detail or clarity because of it. By using Font Awesome, they can add basic icons to their sites and scale them to the required size, limited only by the dimensions of their documents – and they can so without losing definition. You can look upon scalable icons in the same way as scalable font characters.
